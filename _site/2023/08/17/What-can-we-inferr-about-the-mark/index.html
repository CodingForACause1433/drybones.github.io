<hr />

<p>The mark of the beast, what is it and what characteristics
will it most likely have?</p>

<p>The mark of the beast is a mark which everyone will be
required to have in order to buy and sell. It’s not clear when
the mark will come or exactly what it will look like, but from
its description in Revelation 13:16-17 we’ve done our best to
try and piece together a rough idea of the characteristics and
qualities the mark will probably have.</p>

<p>Before we dive in, here is the description of the mark from
the thirteenth chapter of the Revelation.</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">
"He caused all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name." 
</blockquote>
<p><cite style="text-align: right; display: block;"><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A16-17&amp;version=KJV" target="_blank">- Revelation 13:16-17 </a></cite></p>

<pre>
</pre>

<p>From the description about the mark we can conclude a few
things right off the bat.</p>

<pre>
</pre>

<h4 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The mark of the beast will be in the right hand or forehead.</li>
  <li>The mark will be used for buying and selling.</li>
  <li>If you don’t have the mark you won’t be able to buy or sell.</li>
  <li>The mark is meant for everyone, “all”.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these Guarantees we can conclude a few other things that
I will also call guarantees.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Since you can’t buy or sell without the mark, every seller will need to be able to determine if you have the mark or not, even online retailers.</li>
  <li>The mark will need to be accessible to everyone in the world.</li>
  <li>The mark will be some form of computer technology, otherwise it’d be unfeasible to implement on a global scale.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I think these three concluded guarantees have immense
implications for the mark. The implications of the three
things I just mentioned lead me to believe when the mark comes
it will have these next few qualities. The mark would need to
be <strong>unforgeable, unstealable, undupicatable, unhackable, yet
always recoverable.</strong></p>

<pre>
</pre>

<h4 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h4>
<p>Why would it need to have those qualities?
If you are going to convince billions of people to take the
mark with as little resistance as possible, (which I assume is
the goal) they’ll have to be certain that all of their money
is safe and will always be safe while using the mark system.
If the mark is the only thing you can use in order to buy and
sell then all of their money and accounts will need to be
linked to the mark in some way. So, if it were to get
destroyed in a car wreck or accident, forcefully removed by a
crook, duplicated by a thief, or hacked by a hacker, you’d
have to have a way to stop or prevent any of that from
affecting the mark bearer’s wealth, or from it happening in
the first place.</p>

<p>The only real way you could make sure that the mark is
unstealable, unduplicateable, unhackable, yet always
recoverable is to tie each mark to a person’s biometric data,
like their DNA. This way the mark could only work if it was in
the proper owner’s hand or forehead, and even if the mark was
duplicated it wouldn’t work without the owner’s biometric
data, possibly DNA, present.</p>

<pre>
</pre>

<h4 id="recoverability">Recoverability</h4>
<p>Regarding the need to make the mark always recoverable, if
someone was in an accident for instance, and their hand was
crushed along with their mark, then they’d need to be able to
recover their money somehow. If the mark was linked to their
biometrics data  they could go to a recovery office of some
sort and let them scan their biometric data to recover their
account and to get a replacement mark. So, that would ensure
even if the mark was destroyed their wealth wouldn’t be. This
NECESSITATES that the mark be tied to a person’s biometric
data. Otherwise if the chip was destroyed then they’d lose
access to all of their funds and have no way of recovering
their money except by extremely less fraud proof methods, like
word of mouth or ID’s.</p>

<p>In order to maintain the qualities of the mark being
unstealable, unhackable, unduplicatable, yet always
recoverable, I think the mark system would also NEED to
prohibit anyone who hasn’t registered for a mark from buying
and selling on the mark system. This means that computers
won’t have the ability to buy or sell things on the mark
system, UNLESS, a person with a mark gives them permission to
do so for that specific transaction. (This would ensure that
those without a mark couldn’t buy or sell even with a
computer, staying true to the mark’s description in Revelation
13.)</p>

<pre>
</pre>

<h4 id="fraud-prevention">Fraud Prevention</h4>
<p>In order to stop computers, hackers, or people who don’t have
the mark, from buying or selling things online, this would
also NECESSITATE that a person tie their biometric data with
their mark. Requiring biometric data to use the mark and not
allowing any duplicates would help ensure the system that
anyone using the mark system to buy and sell is someone the
system can trust and not a bad actor or hacker. If the mark
wasn’t tied to a person’s biometric data lots of fraud, theft,
and money laundering would take place like we see with online
money and cryptocurrencies nowadays, since none of it is tied
to an online users actual identity.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think the mark will most likely run on
block chain technology, but to prevent fraud, scams, and theft,
each account holder on the mark system’s block chain would have
their account linked to a biometric digital ID. This ensures
that each and every transaction would be traceable and
transparent. Thus disallowing anyone from exchanging money
secretly or engaging in fraudulent activity.</p>

<p>If the mark didn’t have people’s biometric data linked to it,I
think much of the public wouldn’t put much faith in it because
then it would be easier to steal, duplicate, forge, and would
be much harder to recover. If the mark doesn’t offer anyone
any more financial security than they already have then why
would they get it? If you want people to adopt new technology
then something has to be in it for them or it’s going to be an
uphill battle from the start.</p>

<pre>
</pre>

<h4 id="perks-of-the-mark">Perks of the Mark</h4>
<p>From the perspective of someone who is either creating the
mark or wanting to sell it to the public, if they make the
system have the characteristics and qualities along the lines
of what I’ve mentioned prior, that will give the users LOTS of
perks compared to the current economic system.</p>

<p>With the mark you’d essentially be unrobable, monetarily. If
someone does rob you it couldn’t be your money, or the
transaction would be traceable and they’d be caught. Same for
if someone scammed you.</p>

<p>If governments are distributing welfare programs the mark
would also server to prevent corrupt officials from siphoning
funds to secret private bank accounts and instead ensure that
whatever money is set aside for welfare programs goes to the
people it’s intended to go to.</p>

<p>Transferring money to anyone would be possible from anywhere.
So if someone from India wants to send money to a relative in
the UK, they could do so almost instantly and seamlessly using
the mark system.</p>

<p>Honestly, compared to the current system there are a fair
number of benefits that a mark of the beast system could bring
about to the current financial systems in place, and that’s
why I think most people will take it.</p>

<p>That being said, I think there is an even better “financial”
or “economic” system out there than any monetary one, but
that’s for another article.</p>

<pre>
</pre>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>In sum, I personally believe that the mark will come about and have these characteristics:
	* You won’t be able to buy or sell if you don’t have the mark.
	* It will be a mark in the right hand or forehead.
	* It will be a form of computer technology.
	* It will be tied to a person’s biometric data.
	* It will operate on block chain technology.
	* In order to buy and sell on the mark system the system will first need your biometric data.</p>

<p>Now, regardless of how many of these characteristics I’ve
shared are certain, there is ONE characteristic of the mark that
IS a certainty, that is we won’t be able to buy or sell if we
don’t have the mark.</p>

<p>Knowing this certainty I hope that each of us seeks God’s will
for how we live our lives now. If we keep our hearts and minds
open to God showing us ways to live without needing a paying
job or money NOW then I think we’ll all be much better
prepared when the mark comes.</p>

<p>If you’d like to find out more about how to prepare to live without the mark feel free to write to the email

<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

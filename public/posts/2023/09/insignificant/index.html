        <p>Maybe not every task needs to be monumental. Perhaps the little things in life, the things we won’t remember, are what will count most. We’d like to think we’ll be remembered by the great things we do, the daring, the brave, but what most sums up each of us is the small qualities that continuously show themselves each and every day.</p>
<p>For the most part, the great people are never born great, slaying dragons, rescuing princesses, saving the day. They have spent most of their life preparing, gaining wisdom, increasing daily in discipline and then, when the opportunity arises they show their colors.</p>
<p>But, even if we do such great deeds, what will count for us in eternity? Will the moments we think mattered most in life be secondary to ones we wrote off, disregarded, convinced ourselves didn’t matter at the time? The time we left a friend alone, the time we forsook the homeless, the time we indulged ourselves instead of extending a helping hand.</p>
<p>Sometimes the small things, the hello from a friend, the smile from a stranger, the kind gesture, are what help each of us get through a tough day, and sometimes what sticks with us through the rest of it too. It’s easy to be a cynic and think that none of this matters. That what you do in the grand scheme of things won’t change the course of history. But, I dare to think that some of the most influential men in the world, are unknown to most. Small decisions made by one man could have changed and forever altered the course of history while we are blissfully unaware.</p>

<hr>
<p>The mark of the beast, what is it and what characteristics will it most likely have?</p>
<p>The mark of the beast is a mark which everyone will be required to have in order to buy and sell. It’s not clear when the mark will come or exactly what it will look like, but from its description in Revelation 13:16-17 we’ve done our best to try and piece together a rough idea of the characteristics and qualities the mark will probably have.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, here is the description of the mark from the thirteenth chapter of the Revelation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;He caused all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of its name.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A16-17&version=KJV">- Revelation 13:16-17</a></p>
<p>From the description about the mark we can conclude a few things right off the bat.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="guarantees">Guarantees</h3>
<ul>
<li>The mark of the beast will be in the right hand or forehead.</li>
<li>The mark will be used for buying and selling.</li>
<li>If you don’t have the mark you won’t be able to buy or sell.</li>
<li>The mark is meant for everyone, “all”.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these Guarantees we can conclude a few other things that I will also call guarantees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Since you can’t buy or sell without the mark, every seller will need to be able to determine if you have the mark or not, even online retailers.</li>
<li>The mark will need to be accessible to everyone in the world.</li>
<li>The mark will be some form of computer technology, otherwise it’d be unfeasible to implement on a global scale.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now I think these three concluded guarantees have immense implications for the mark. The implications of the three things I just mentioned lead me to believe when the mark comes it will have these next few qualities. The mark would need to be <strong>unforgeable, unstealable, undupicatable, unhackable, yet always recoverable.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="reasoning">Reasoning</h3>
<p>Why would it need to have those qualities? If you are going to convince billions of people to take the mark with as little resistance as possible, (which I assume is the goal) they’ll have to be certain that all of their money is safe and will always be safe while using the mark system. If the mark is the only thing you can use in order to buy and sell then all of their money and accounts will need to be linked to the mark in some way. So, if it were to get destroyed in a car wreck or accident, forcefully removed by a crook, duplicated by a thief, or hacked by a hacker, you’d have to have a way to stop or prevent any of that from affecting the mark bearer’s wealth, or from it happening in the first place.</p>
<p>The only real way you could make sure that the mark is unstealable, unduplicateable, unhackable, yet always recoverable is to tie each mark to a person’s biometric data, like their DNA. This way the mark could only work if it was in the proper owner’s hand or forehead, and even if the mark was duplicated it wouldn’t work without the owner’s biometric data, possibly DNA, present.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="recoverability">Recoverability</h3>
<p>Regarding the need to make the mark always recoverable, if someone was in an accident for instance, and their hand was crushed along with their mark, then they’d need to be able to recover their money somehow. If the mark was linked to their biometrics data they could go to a recovery office of some sort and let them scan their biometric data to recover their account and to get a replacement mark. So, that would ensure even if the mark was destroyed their wealth wouldn’t be. This NECESSITATES that the mark be tied to a person’s biometric data. Otherwise if the chip was destroyed then they’d lose access to all of their funds and have no way of recovering their money except by extremely less fraud proof methods, like word of mouth or ID’s.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the qualities of the mark being unstealable, unhackable, unduplicatable, yet always recoverable, I think the mark system would also NEED to prohibit anyone who hasn’t registered for a mark from buying and selling on the mark system. This means that computers won’t have the ability to buy or sell things on the mark system, UNLESS, a person with a mark gives them permission to do so for that specific transaction. (This would ensure that those without a mark couldn’t buy or sell even with a computer, staying true to the mark’s description in Revelation 13.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="fraud-prevention">Fraud Prevention</h3>
<p>In order to stop computers, hackers, or people who don’t have the mark, from buying or selling things online, this would also NECESSITATE that a person tie their biometric data with their mark. Requiring biometric data to use the mark and not allowing any duplicates would help ensure the system that anyone using the mark system to buy and sell is someone the system can trust and not a bad actor or hacker. If the mark wasn’t tied to a person’s biometric data lots of fraud, theft, and money laundering would take place like we see with online money and cryptocurrencies nowadays, since none of it is tied to an online users actual identity.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I think the mark will most likely run on block chain technology, but to prevent fraud, scams, and theft, each account holder on the mark system’s block chain would have their account linked to a biometric digital ID. This ensures that each and every transaction would be traceable and transparent. Thus disallowing anyone from exchanging money secretly or engaging in fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>If the mark didn’t have people’s biometric data linked to it,I think much of the public wouldn’t put much faith in it because then it would be easier to steal, duplicate, forge, and would be much harder to recover. If the mark doesn’t offer anyone any more financial security than they already have then why would they get it? If you want people to adopt new technology then something has to be in it for them or it’s going to be an uphill battle from the start.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="perks-of-the-mark">Perks of the Mark</h3>
<p>From the perspective of someone who is either creating the mark or wanting to sell it to the public, if they make the system have the characteristics and qualities along the lines of what I’ve mentioned prior, that will give the users LOTS of perks compared to the current economic system.</p>
<p>With the mark you’d essentially be unrobable, monetarily. If someone does rob you it couldn’t be your money, or the transaction would be traceable and they’d be caught. Same for if someone scammed you.</p>
<p>If governments are distributing welfare programs the mark would also server to prevent corrupt officials from siphoning funds to secret private bank accounts and instead ensure that whatever money is set aside for welfare programs goes to the people it’s intended to go to.</p>
<p>Transferring money to anyone would be possible from anywhere. So if someone from India wants to send money to a relative in the UK, they could do so almost instantly and seamlessly using the mark system.</p>
<p>Honestly, compared to the current system there are a fair number of benefits that a mark of the beast system could bring about to the current financial systems in place, and that’s why I think most people will take it.</p>
<p>That being said, I think there is an even better “financial” or “economic” system out there than any monetary one, but that’s for another article.
 </p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>In sum, I personally believe that the mark will come about and have these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>You won’t be able to buy or sell if you don’t have the mark.</li>
<li>It will be a mark in the right hand or forehead.</li>
<li>It will be a form of computer technology.</li>
<li>It will be tied to a person’s biometric data.</li>
<li>It will operate on block chain technology.</li>
<li>In order to buy and sell on the mark system the system will first need your biometric data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, regardless of how many of these characteristics I’ve shared are certain, there is ONE characteristic of the mark that IS a certainty, that is we won’t be able to buy or sell if we don’t have the mark.</p>
<p>Knowing this certainty I hope that each of us seeks God’s will for how we live our lives now. If we keep our hearts and minds open to God showing us ways to live without needing a paying job or money NOW then I think we’ll all be much better prepared when the mark comes.</p>
<p>If you’d like to find out more about how to prepare to live without the mark feel free to write to the email on the about page.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>

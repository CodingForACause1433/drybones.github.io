# Things That Are True

There are things in life that are fundamentally true. Not just in the realm of physicality, like if you put your hand in a fire you burn it, but in the realm of reality or relationships. Like if each human decided to not fight in a war there wouldn't be wars. Or if each human decided to share there wouldn't be a need for money. 

What's the most striking of all is that each person has pre-decided in there mind that those truths are not viable. As in, since we don't trust each other to act on those principles we've pre-decided that society as a whole can't function on them. I think the sole reason each person had made up there mind to exclude those possibilities (sharing and refusing to fight) as workable solutions to the problems in the world, is because sometimes there are going to be people who won't chose to do what's right or will want to make us do what's wrong since it benefits them. Who instead will hurt them, act in spite of them, so we try to preserve ourselves, protect ourselves from the potential evil of others. 

How much of this behavior of acting in a way to keep ourselves safe perpetuates everyone else doing the same or acting in a way that lines up with our expectations?

### WHAT IS WORLD COIN?

Worldcoin is a digital crypto currency made to be usable anywhere in the world which already has 2 million people register for it and has received over one hundred and fifty million dollars in funding backed by some big names in the tech and AI industry. It’s supposed to be an inclusive, universal, secure, crypto currency and it’s linked to a digital ID generated from a user’s biometric data, an ID which is required to have if you want to buy or sell using the currency.

This Identifier or for Worldcoin is called a “World ID”. The way you get it is you allow your irises in your eyes to be scanned by a machine they themselves call “The Orb”, an iris biometric data scanning device they made. They then use the biometric data from your irises as a way to verify that you are a unique human.

Worldcoin was made on the premise that eventually AI will become so good at pretending to be human that more advanced ID systems will need to be made to verify that users online ARE human. They fear the current world financial system is at risk of being manipulated by those who will control AI if such an ID system isn’t put in place, and they think the biometric digital passport, the “World ID”, will serve that purpose of determining who is human and who isn’t.

One way or another, they say, a world biometric proof of personhood, a “World ID”, is inevitable, and so instead of letting an evil government build it, they themselves decided to build it and assure us that once the system is in place they’ll distribute power equally and fairly to all…

### WORLDCOIN’S SIMILARITIES TO THE MARK

Those behind Worldcoin think they’re helping humanity, but if any of you are familiar with the description about the mark of the beast in the bible, what they’re saying should be very alarming.

#### Revelation: 13:16-17:

“It caused ALL people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.” [Revelation 13:16-17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+13%3A16-17&version=KJV)

Worldcoin is laying down the groundwork for a global financial system that seems like it could eventually lead to just that! Read their mission statement,

> “Something like World ID will need to happen,” "The mission of the Worldcoin project is to build the world’s largest identity AND financial network as a public utility, giving ownership to EVERYONE."

[Worldcoin](https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics)

In other words, it’s supposed to be a global financial AND identity system for ALL, that you can ONLY use if you allow your eyeballs to be scanned.

So, for example, if a country were to switch to Worldcoin as their state currency and stop using physical cash, as a by-product that WOULD CAUSE ALL, people in their country, to either scan their eyes or be excluded from their own countries economy.

Now, I’m not saying that Worldcoin IS the mark, but the system they are setting up for Worldcoin sure seems eerily similar. They aren’t asking for a mark in the right hand or forehead, but perhaps with time they’ll find that iris scans won’t work for all people, like those who suffer eye damage after signing up and can’t recover their account.

&nbsp;
### WORLDCOIN’S MARKETING

On top of all of this Worldcoin is being sold to the public as a potential solution to some of the fundamental problems of the world like the distribution of power and resources, and hints at possibly being the monetary framework that would allow for a Universal Basic Income, potentially distributed by an AI.

> "Worldcoin could significantly increase equality of opportunity globally by advancing a future where everyone, regardless of their location, can participate in the global digital economy through universally-accessible decentralized financial and identity infrastructure. As the network grows, so should its utility."

[Worldcoin](https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/)

> "Furthermore, World ID can also enable global democratic processes and novel forms of governance (e.g., via quadratic voting), and it may eventually support a path to AI-funded Universal Basic Income."

[Worldcoin - Tokenomics](https://whitepaper.worldcoin.org/tokenomics)

What Worldcoin is claiming that it will offer the potential to revolutionize the current systems that mankind have in place for governing ourselves, buying and selling, and making and doing business. But will Worldcoin, or any global economic and identity system made and created by humans really be able to overcome the problems that plague humanity?

&nbsp;
### THE CO-FOUNDER OF WORLDCOIN

Take a look at the track record of the Co-founder of Worldcoin himself, Sam Altman, to see the direction Worldcoin will most likely take in the future.

He is the co-founder of Worldcoin and the current CEO of OpenAI. – _OpenAI is the company that owns and opperates ChatGPT, the AI chatbot._ – He ironically, helped start OpenAI in 2015 as a nonprofit research organization committed to advancing digital intelligence for the benefit of humanity, promising to be transparent and share their findings with the world.

Fast-forward to today though, and OpenAI is now a profit-driven company in bed with Microsoft sharing very little if any of their findings with anyone.

If Sam Altman’s track record says anything, it’s that his ideals, like most others’, quickly fall to the wayside once money gets involved. Besides that his company “Worldcoin” even admits that they are making the biometric ID only because they think someone worse than them will make it in the future if they don’t.

> "But the biggest risk, as the company’s braintrust sees it, is not a risk about Worldcoin itself. The most chilling risk, to them, is that something like a biometric World ID will be developed, only not in a way that’s open or privacy-preserving."

[Coindesk](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/the-untold-story-of-worldcoins-launch-inside-the-orb/)

> “I think Worldcoin is the only other path there is.”

[Alex Blania - Co-founder of Worldcoin](https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/07/24/the-untold-story-of-worldcoins-launch-inside-the-orb/)

They are convinced that the only way forward for humanity, the solution, is a universal global economic and identification system in which you need to allow biometric data to be taken from you in order to buy and sell and they don’t see another way. Alex Blania, the other Co-founder of Worldcoin, also thinks this and this will be the same conclusion that most other people in the world will arrive at, because they think it’s the only way.

&nbsp;
### THE SOLUTION

BUT, there is another way. The other way is that humans share… and instead of putting our trust in our own creations like the idol worshippers of the past did, we put our faith in a loving God. The one who he sent his son to share his simple solution to the problems we face today almost two millennia ago.

His son said, “You cannot serve two masters. You will hate one and love the other, or despise one and admire the other. You cannot serve BOTH God and money.” Yet the human race goes on working for money. If the human race would stop working for money and share all they have with one another there would be no NEED for money, or Worldcoin. Sharing doesn’t require money, onlylove. And that’s what God is.

So if the human race would focus on serving God and our fellow humans we WOULD be able to solve all of the world’s problems, but only IF we listen to him and to his son’s teachings.

So which will it be, Love, or money?

One will lead to a global world ID and financial system in which you’ll need to register for in order to buy and sell, while the other will lead to a global system built on trust in a loving creator held together by a volunteer workforce motivated by love.

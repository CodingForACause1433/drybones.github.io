Hello, it seemed appropriate to me to write something about how I understand life, its purpose, and our reasons for existence. Not to say that you need to think like me, but I guess to share so you know where I’m coming from. Take what you like and throw away what you don’t, but I hope that some of this helps you.

I wasn’t sure why I was here at first, or what my purpose was, but after living for a while I discovered a man’s teachings unlike any other through a Youtube Channel. I tried to implement those teachings in my life as best I could, and came to see them as true. These teachings I am refering to are the ones that come from Jesus in the bible. I saw that what he taught was ignored by churches and people of all different backgrounds, and after implementing them in my life I started to see the reason for Jesus’ teachings.

Jesus teaches that if you want to follow him we must forsake all that we own, for example, and at first I just didn’t understand why. WHY did I need to give up all I own? Why did I need to stop working for money, like he said to do in Matthew 6? What good would it do?

Now I see though that Jesus didn’t come to tell us to do meaningless or purposeless rules as a crap test in life like most people think God does. “Eat this cracker”, “Drink this juice”, “Pay tithes to the church”, etc. That isn’t what Jesus taught and isn’t the type of meaningless stuff that he wants us to do.

He came to build something called the kingdom of heaven. This isn’t some kingdom in the clouds where we recline on white fluff while babyfaced angels feed us grapes and play harps, this is a government that he came to build here on earth. One that anyone can help build and that requires human effort and cooperation to bring about.

I believe that it’s our purpose as humans to bring about that kingdom. And, only when necessary will God ever step in to help. I believe he’s mainly leaving it up to us to build it, so we can learn and develop ourselves.

For now he’s in the recruiting stages of his kingdom, where he’s seeing who puts their trust in him, in the truth, and in love and justice, and lives for those values regardless of if those around them do or not. You don’t want your kingdom full of cowards, whimps, and liars, and so in some sense I do believe this life is a test, but one that isn’t a waste of time. We’ll be able to keep whatever we learn here. Whatever skills we develop we’ll take with us when we’re resurrected.

I can’t say I know for sure exactly what happens after that but I do know that for 1,000 years 140,000 followers of his will help him rule the earth due to what it says in the book of Revelation. I think during this time we’ll be able to have a fresh start and be given the ability to literally bring “heaven” to earth. That being said, I also believe that if we humans get our act together now we could bring heaven to earth now rather than later. The problem is we face opposition.

The shortsighted, the greedy, the envious, and our own wants and desires prevent us from striving to build this kingdom that will last forever. The men and women who want to bring about this world of peace where no one lacks and everyone has what they need, are confronted by those who want more than their fair-share. Most people in the world today fall in that category, and if we’re not careful even we ourselves fall into that category at times. That’s I think why we need to forsake all we own. To give away our possessions and lay all our hopes and dreams on the alter. God asked that much of his first follower, Abraham, and he doesn’t ask any less of us.

If we can muster up the faith and courage to act on God’s will, then doing so will allow us to successfully bring about heaven on earth, even if it’s just a little section of it. Otherwise we may find ourselves fighting against the very kingdom of God.

Are you interested in building God’s kingdom? It’s not one that can be observed but rather one that resides in the hearts of men and comes about through love, truth, and justice. If you want to build that kingdom then I recommend that you read through Jesus teachings. A place to get started reading is Matthew chapter 5, 6, and 7.

Building God’s kingdom will take a life time, constant openness to God’s voice, a humble and contrite heart, and a desire to do what right even if it doesn’t benefit ourselves. Do you feel that God is calling you to to be part of such a kingdom, his kingdom?
